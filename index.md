# Welcome to Machine Intelligence for Medical Engineering Team
---

# Introduction
Our goal is to invent intelligent systems assisting medical diagnosis and treatment by extracting useful features from medical information, and combining them with powerful computational resources and vast amount of data in the cyber space. To tackle this challenging problem, we utilize all resources in the area of computer science including mathematical basis and robotics.

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/MedicalEngRIKEN/MedicalEngRIKEN.github.io/edit/main/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown
Syntax highlighted code block

# Header 1

- List

1. Numbered
2. List

**Bold** and _Italic_ and `Code` text

[Link](url) and ![Image](src)
```

For more details see [Basic writing and formatting syntax](https://docs.github.com/en/github/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax).

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/MedicalEngRIKEN/MedicalEngRIKEN.github.io/settings/pages). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
