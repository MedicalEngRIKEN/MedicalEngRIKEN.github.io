# Introduction
Our goal is to invent intelligent systems assisting medical diagnosis and treatment by extracting useful features from medical information, and combining them with powerful computational resources and vast amount of data in the cyber space. To tackle this challenging problem, we utilize all resources in the area of computer science including mathematical basis and robotics.
